# Rust Competetive Programming Template

This is my personal template for when solving small problems in Rust.

The idea is that you copy the template when starting a new project, and then solve it in _main.rs_ using helper functions such as parsing integers from the lib. If you want to submit the code to a website, you can run _bundle.sh_ to bundle the whole crate into a single _bundled.rs_ file.
